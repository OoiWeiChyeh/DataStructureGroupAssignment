# Pizza Kitchen Display System

## Overview

This project is a console-based Pizza Kitchen Display system created for the **Data Structures (DCS2101)** module at the **School of Engineering and Technology (SOEAT)**. The system allows restaurant staff to track pizza orders, manage queues, and process orders in real-time, using various data structures to efficiently handle the queuing system.

### Project Details
- **Module**: Data Structures (DCS2101)
- **Session**: August 2024
- **Lecturer**: Lai Kim Min
- **Percentage of Coursework**: 30%

## Features

- **Pizza Ordering System**: Users can choose the type, size, and quantity of pizzas, and order details are loaded from the file `pizza.txt`【11†source】.
- **Kitchen Display**: Staff can view and manage queued orders with indicators showing which pizza is currently being prepared【12†source】.
- **Queue Management**: Pizzas can be added, removed, or processed in the queue, with restrictions on modifying the first pizza in preparation.
  
## Learning Outcomes
This project demonstrates the use of data structures such as linked lists, queues, and stacks to solve real-world problems related to order processing and management in a restaurant environment【12†source】.

## System Structure
1. **UI Design**: Console-based interface with a menu for selecting options.
2. **Order Module**: Handles pizza orders, including pizza type, size, and quantity.
3. **Kitchen Module**: Displays queued pizzas and allows staff to manage order processing.
4. **Abstraction Data Type**: Classes such as `Pizza` and `Order` are used to encapsulate order data.
5. **Data Structures**: Efficient data structures are implemented to handle order queues.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pizza-kitchen-system.git
   ```
2. Load the pizza details from `pizza.txt` into the system.
3. Run the console program and follow the menu to order pizzas and manage the kitchen queue.

## Files Included
- **pizza.txt**: Contains the details of available pizzas, including their names, sizes, and prices【11†source】.
- **Project Report**: A report detailing the system design, implementation, and reflections on the project【12†source】.

## Submission Details
- **Due Date**: 22nd November 2024
- **Submission Requirements**:
  - Working program (softcopy format).
  - Evaluation report with test data and reflection【12†source】.
